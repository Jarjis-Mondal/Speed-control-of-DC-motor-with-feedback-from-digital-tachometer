# Speed-control-of-DC-motor-with-feedback-from-digital-tachometer
This project focuses on dynamically regulating a DC motor's speed using feedback from a digital tachometer.
The ability to precisely control motor speed is crucial in many industrial and automation applications. The project uses a digital tachometer to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of motor speed regulation. It also applies modern technology and control theory to optimize the performance of electromechanical systems in practical scenarios.
